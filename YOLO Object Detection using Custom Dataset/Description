Number of categories: 120

The Annotations label was in Pascal VOC format.So to make it compatiple to YOLO format i.e txt file for each label along with bounding box dimanesions, uisng python script pascal voc format was converted to yolo format.


For training of YOLO, darknet framework was used and training was implemented in Google Colab for easy use of GPU. The changes were made in the cfg file of yolo according to the requirement of the custom dataset.
